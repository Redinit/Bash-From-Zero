# Introduction to Bash Scripting üöÄ


> ‚ÄúWarning: May contain bugs.‚Äù üêûüí•

Welcome to my **Bash scripting journey**! This guide will walk you through the essentials of Bash, including what is shell, why writing scripts, using the shebang line, managing file permissions and how executing scripts.

---

## üñ•Ô∏è What is Bash?

- **Bash** stands for **Bourne Again SHell**
- It is a command-line interpreter (CLI) that allows you to interact with the operating system.
- Acts as an intermediary between the user and the OS, allowing execution of commands and programs without a GUI
- Offers power and flexibility for task automation, combining commands, and writing scripts

## üìÇ Understanding Shells

A **shell** enables you to:
- Execute programs
- Run system commands
- Manage files and processes

A **shell** is an intermediary between the user and the OS kernel, enabling execution of commands and programs without using a GUI.

## üìù Bash Scripts
A **script** is simply a text file containing one or more commands.

Bash scripts can include **programming features** like:
- Variables
- Conditional statements (`if`, `else`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- Functions

Scripts allow us to **automate tasks**, reduce manual effort, and improve consistency.

## ‚ö° The Shebang Line (`#!/bin/bash`)

Most Bash scripts begin with a shebang line:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
```
This tells the operating system which interpreter to use when running the script.
### Examples in Other Languages
| Language | Shebang              |
|----------|----------------------|
| Python   | `#!/usr/bin/python3` |
| Perl     | `#!/usr/bin/perl`    |

### üí° Why it matters:

   * When we run ./script.sh, the OS checks the shebang to determine how to execute the script
   * If we run bash script.sh, the shebang is ignored because Bash is explicitly invoked

## File Permissions in Linux

Linux uses permission bits to control access to files:

| Permission | Symbol | Meaning              |
|------------|--------|----------------------|
| Read       | `r`    | View file contents   |
| Write      | `w`    | Modify file contents |
| Execute    | `x`    | Run the file         |

## Making a Script Executable

To make a script executable:
```bash
# give execute permission to the script
chmod +x scriptname.sh
```

* Without the execute bit (x), we cannot run the script using ./script.sh
* However, we can still run it directly via the interpreter:
```bash
bash scriptname.sh
```

## üöÄ Running Bash Scripts

There are two common methods to run a Bash script:
1. Direct Execution (requires execute permission):
```bash
chmod +x scriptname.sh # give execute permission to the script 
./scriptname.sh          # execute script directly
```

2. Using the Interpreter Explicitly (no execute permission required):
```bash
bash scriptname.sh           # run script by specifying the interpreter (bash)
```

## Example Scripts

Try these scripts for this topic:

- [hello_world.sh](../scripts/01_introduction_basics/hello_World.sh)


### Running the Scripts

There are **two ways to run the scripts**:

1. **If you cloned the full repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Redinit/bash-from-zero.git
cd bash-from-zero/scripts/01_introduction_basics
chmod +x hello_world.sh   # first time only
./hello_bash.sh
```
2. **If you only downloaded a single script file**:
```bash
bash hello_world.sh
# or (optional)
chmod +x hello_world.sh
./hello_world.sh
```
